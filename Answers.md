1. What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve? Support your answer with concepts introduced in class and from your personal research on the web.

React JS is a way to better manage changes to the DOM. Instead of reloading the whole DOM, we can manage state via react and use the virtual DOM to update just the part that needs updating. 

1. What does it mean to think in react?

I think it means to think in terms of state and managing state.

1. Describe state.

State is just the nature of the app as it is. If you set the background to red, the state of the background is red. 

1. Describe props.

Props are basically data being passed up the component chain in a read-only format. 

1. What are side effects, and how do you sync effects in a React component to state or prop changes?

Side effects are essentially unintended behavior. You can sync effects in a react component to state or prop changes by using useEffect();.
